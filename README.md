# Grasshoppr
Socio Commerce platform for cannabis enthusiasts

Welcome to the Cannabis-Co-Creation wiki!

For Cannabis Enthusiasts:

Cannabis is well-known for its healing properties and is being extensively used by a leading European pharma company to synthesize mild painkillers which do not have any side effects. Research has shown that cannabis has potential in managing Alzemhier diseases, traumatic injuries and boosting people's creativity. Unlike other mild drugs, Natural Cannabis growth does not affect the soil nutrients and can be grown on lesser fertile soil. It is not a good idea to consider cannabis use as a gateway to hard drugs. It is rather a nature-given-gift to human so that we can exploit for its fruitful benefits. Infact, legalization of Cannabis has shown a diminution in hard-drug, alcohol-abuse and painkiller-popping habits among common population.

Recreational use of cannabis has been legalized in 7 US states, and medical use is legalized in 29 US states as of 2017. The cannabis market is expected to grow by at least by 17% annually. It also expected that cannabis industry may touch a whopping 20B+ and is expected to create a 300K+ employment opportunity by 2020. It is still political, debatable and a game of probability.

Vision: We are cannabis enthusiasts trying to create an open source socio-commerce platform for the Grassshopprs. We are calling it the one-stop solution for the legal cannabis industry. The other main goal of the platform is to create a real-time cannabis health platform. We are here to co-create it through the power of people and passionate software hustlers.

Mission:
To drive creativity, user experience and software quality in the cannabis commerce and social networking software industry.
To keep the complexity low to enable mass co-creation.
